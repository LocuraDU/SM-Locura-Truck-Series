# Information
The Locura T750 Chassis Cab. This chassis cab version is ready for whatever use you may have. Drive as is or build exactly what you need for gameplay on the back. Rear suspension is a live axle set up with quad offroad suspension on each main axle. Load axle is a dual suspension setup. Driver and passenger doors open as well as the hood. Like a real Chassis Cab the suspension is going to be very hard until you put a load on it. If you plan on just using the vehicle as is you may want to soften the rear suspension. Only drop the rear load axle if you have a heavy load. Otherwise you get massive wheelspin.
