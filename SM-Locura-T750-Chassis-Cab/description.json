   "description" : "Loosely based on the Kosmo chassis from his YouTube channel.\n\nI have multiple versions to fit your needs. \n Chassis Cab\n Stake Bed\n Dump Bed\n Box Bed\n Mobile Base\n Flat Bed\n Rollback (Slide Version)\n Rollback (Arm Version)\n\n All my items are mod free. All vanilla parts with no glitches or hacks being used. All downloads have been tested in creative and survival modes. For importing workshop items to survival some pretty good youtube tutorials are available. \n\nVehicle Details-\n This download is for the Chassis Cab version. This version comes with no bed or utility on the back allowing you to easily make your own to fit your needs. If you have issues getting out or want to get out faster just remove the sunroof. Truck has storage on both sides. One fuel container on each side for each engine and 2 large crates on each side. Rear suspension is a live axle set up with quad offroad suspension on each axle. Driver and passenger doors open as well as the hood. Like a real Chassis Cab the suspension is going to be very hard until you put a load on it. If you plan on just using the vehicle as is you may want to soften the rear suspension.\n\nVehicle Functions-\n1: Doors\n2: Hood\n3: Horn\n4: Main Lights\n5: Aux Lights\n6: Not Used\n7: Not Used\n8: Not Used\n9: Not Used\n0: Not Used",
