All vanilla parts with no glitches or hacks being used. All downloads have been tested in creative and survival modes. For importing workshop items to survival some pretty good youtube tutorials are available. \n\nVehicle Details-\n This download is for the Box Bed version. This version comes with a large enclosed box bed on the chassis. If you have issues getting out or want to get out faster just remove the sunroof. Truck has storage on both sides. One fuel container on each side for each engine and 2 large crates on each side. Rear suspension is a live axle set up with quad offroad suspension on each axle. Driver and passenger doors open as well as the hood, rear ramp, and rear doors. Please be sure to drop the loading ramp down before opening the rear cargo doors.\n\nVehicle Functions-\n1: Doors\n2: Hood\n3: Horn\n4: Main Lights\n5: Aux Lights\n6: Cargo Lights\n7: Loading Ramp\n8: Cargo Doors\n9: Not Used\n0: Not Used",
