   "description" : "Loosely based on the Kosmo chassis from his YouTube channel.\n\nI have multiple versions to fit your needs. \n Chassis Cab\n Stake Bed\n Dump Bed\n Box Bed\n Mobile Base\n Flat Bed\n Rollback (Slide Version)\n Rollback (Arm Version)\n\n All my items are mod free. All vanilla parts with no glitches or hacks being used. All downloads have been tested in creative and survival modes. For importing workshop items to survival some pretty good youtube tutorials are available. \n\nVehicle Details-\n This download is for the T950 Mobile Base version. Was the T750 just not heavy duty enough for you? The T950 is the same awesome truck as the T750 but with much more loading power. This version comes with a large utility on the back for your mobile base. If you have issues getting out or want to get out faster just remove the sunroof. Truck has storage on both sides. One fuel container on each side for each engine. 2 large crates on each side. As well as 1 ammo container on each side. Rear suspension is a live axle set up with quad offroad suspension on each main axle. Load axle is a dual suspension setup. Driver and passenger doors open as well as the hood. Load axle can be used to help level and balance the weight while parked, or used to stiffen the ride while driving.\n\nVehicle Functions-\n1: Doors\n2: Hood\n3: Horn\n4: Main Lights\n5: Aux Lights\n6: Cargo Lights\n7: Load Axle\n8: Rear Door\n9: Not Used\n0: Not Used",
