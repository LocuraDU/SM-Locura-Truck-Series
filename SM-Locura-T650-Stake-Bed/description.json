All vanilla parts with no glitches or hacks being used. All downloads have been tested in creative and survival modes. For importing workshop items to survival some pretty good youtube tutorials are available. \n\nVehicle Details-\n This download is for the Stake Bed version. This version comes with a large flat bed that keeps cargo from falling off the bed, perfect for farmers. If you have issues getting out or want to get out faster just remove the sunroof. Truck has storage on both sides. 4 large chests on the right side, as well as 1 water container, 2 fuel containers, and 1 ammo container on the left side. Rear suspension is a dual shock independant setup. Driver and passenger doors open as well as the hood.
